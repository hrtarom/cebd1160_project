### Resources
Your repository should include the following:

- Python script for your analysis
- Results figure/saved file
- Dockerfile for your experiment
- runtime-instructions in a file named RUNME.md

-----

## Research Question

1 sentence description of your research question.

### Abstract

4 sentence longer explanation about your research question. Include:

- opportunity (what data do we have)
- challenge (what is the "problem" we could solve with this dataset)
- action (how will we try to solve this problem/answer this question)
- resolution (what did we end up producing)

### Introduction


Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. n the 3-dimensional space is that described in: [K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: "Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets", Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].
Attribute Information:

1) ID number 2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign) 3-32)

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter) b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values) c) perimeter d) area e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths) f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0) g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour) h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour) i) symmetry j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

The mean, standard error and "worst" or largest (mean of the three largest values) of these features were computed for each image, resulting in 30 features. For instance, field 3 is Mean Radius, field 13 is Radius SE, field 23 is Worst Radius.

All feature values are recoded with four significant digits.

Missing attribute values: none

Class distribution: 357 benign, 212 malignant
### Methods

Brief (no more than 1-2 paragraph) description about how you decided to approach solving it. Include:

- pseudocode for this method (either created by you or cited from somewhere else)
- why you chose this method

### Results

Brief (2 paragraph) description about your results. Include:

- At least 1 figure
- At least 1 "value" that summarizes either your data or the "performance" of your method
- A short explanation of both of the above

### Discussion
Brief (no more than 1-2 paragraph) description about what you did. Include:

- interpretation of whether your method "solved" the problem
- suggested next step that could make it better.
